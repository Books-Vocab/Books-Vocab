"""Concurrent accounting correctness for `kg.token_tracker`.

`test_sqlite_concurrency.test_token_tracker_concurrent_writes_no_locked` already
proves the writer does not crash with ``database is locked``. These tests cover
the *ledger* — the SUMs and per-user isolation that downstream billing/quota
trusts — under contended writes, plus a read-during-write snapshot probe.

Three regressions guarded here:

1. lost-update: concurrent INSERTs from N threads against one user must not
   drop rows. `SUM(input_tokens)` and `SUM(output_tokens)` must equal the
   total quantity written.
2. user isolation: parallel writers targeting *different* user_ids must not
   bleed rows across users (one user's sum staying intact while another is
   hammered).
3. snapshot consistency: a reader calling `get_all_stats()` while writers
   pound the same table must (a) never raise, and (b) only ever observe a
   monotonically-growing prefix — never a partial / corrupted row.
