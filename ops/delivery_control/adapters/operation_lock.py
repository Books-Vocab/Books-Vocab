"""Cross-process serialization for delivery-control mutations.

The delivery CLI can be invoked concurrently by a supervisor, an integrator,
or a cleanup retry.  Registry CAS protects the ledger, but Git operations such
as sync, worktree removal, and branch deletion still share the repository's
index and refs.  This lock serializes registry read-modify-write and local
worktree/ref mutation while leaving observation commands concurrent.  Most
mutating commands hold it for their whole run; ``queue``, ``cleanup-merged``
and ``release-published`` take it only around those local sections, so their
GitHub API calls, ``ls-remote`` and ``push`` run outside it (#2236).  The
lease is non-blocking by default; ``KG_DELIVERY_LOCK_WAIT_SECONDS=N`` (>0) opts
into polling every ~0.1s for up to N seconds before the same busy refusal
(#2423).  The kernel
releases the lock when the owning process exits, so a stale lock file is
harmless.
