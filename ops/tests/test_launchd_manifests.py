"""Every ops/launchd/*.plist is the versioned source of a deployed job (#2071).

com.butler.kg-disk-guard.plist was named by no other file, was reported as a
dead leftover, and is in fact loaded on felix (~/Library/LaunchAgents,
StartInterval 300, last exit 0) — deleting it would have dropped the only
copy of that job's definition. An undocumented manifest is indistinguishable
from a dead one, so each must be named by at least one other tracked file that
says where it is installed, and carry a Label matching its filename (the name
`launchctl print gui/<uid>/<label>` and the docs use).

The Label is read with a regex, not plistlib: launchd's CFPropertyList parser
accepts the `--` inside the XML comments of com.kg.reconcile / com.kg.uisweep
(`plutil -lint` OK), strict expat does not.
