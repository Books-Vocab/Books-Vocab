"""Startup reaper for orphaned staged shared-deck copies (#2269).

A copy stages its notebook hidden (``is_staged``) and compensates on any
in-process failure. A hard crash between staging and compensation (or between
the cards landing and ``record_copy``) leaves a staged notebook with committed
cards and no ``shared_deck_copy_log`` row — invisible but never cleaned. This
sweep compensates those: cards tombstoned, graph file and notebook row removed.
A notebook whose cleanup failed stays staged (cards still hidden) and is retried
by the next sweep; it is not counted as reaped.

A staged notebook WITH a copy_log row is a committed copy awaiting reveal; the
retry's ``_replay`` self-heals it, so it is left alone, as is anything younger
than ``older_than`` (a live copy may still be running).
