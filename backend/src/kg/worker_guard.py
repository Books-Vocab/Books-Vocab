"""Fail-loud guard that the API runs as a single Uvicorn worker.

Three subsystems silently depend on a single-worker deploy because their
state is purely process-local:

  * ``quota_service._reservations`` — in-flight quota reservations. With N
    workers each holds its own copy, so the over-spend ceiling becomes N×.
  * ``translate_service._INFLIGHT`` — singleflight dedup. N workers ⇒ N×
    cache stampede on the same word.
  * ``pipeline_log`` — on startup it marks orphaned ``running`` rows
    ``interrupted``; multi-worker, workers cross-mark each other's runs.

The Dockerfile pins ``--workers 1``, but nothing *enforced* it — a change
to the worker count would silently break all three. This guard turns the
invariant fail-loud: each worker process takes an exclusive ``flock`` on a
shared lock file at startup. The first worker wins; a second worker's
non-blocking ``flock`` fails and we raise, so that worker refuses to boot.
