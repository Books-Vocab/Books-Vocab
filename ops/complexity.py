"""Complexity budget: the delivery tooling may not quietly outgrow the product.

Line ceilings (authored code and docs only, never data files) for the areas that only ever grow by accretion (`ops/`,
`docs/`, `.github/workflows/`) live in ``ops/complexity_budget.json``.

    ./ops/complexity.py check      # exit 1 when an area is over its ceiling
    ./ops/complexity.py ratchet    # lower ceilings to current + slack; never raises
    ./ops/complexity.py show       # numbers, headroom, and ops : ios ratio

Going over means one of two visible acts in the PR: delete something, or edit the
ceiling in the budget file so a reviewer sees the number and the reason.  The
ceiling is therefore a decision, not a side effect.  ``ratchet`` only moves it
down, so deletions are banked and cannot be spent again silently.

A lane gate charges a lane only for its own growth.  Per area, delta = lines now minus lines at the
merge-base (``origin/main``, else ``main``), counted by the same ``count_lines`` rule on both sides.
The lane passes when delta <= the headroom the area had at the merge-base (ceiling read from the
budget file *at the base*), or when the lane itself raises the ceiling in the budget file (then the
new ceiling is judged absolutely).  Two sibling lanes that each fit the base headroom therefore both
pass, also after a rebase onto each other (headroom = the larger of the current merge-base's and the
lane's original fork point's: ``KG_COMPLEXITY_FORK_BASE``, else the branch's reflog creation commit,
else the CI merge commit's PR fork); absolute overflow of the checked tree is then only a WARNING that main needs a rebaseline PR.
On main itself (HEAD is the base) or with ``--absolute``/``--strict`` (CI on push to ``main``, see
``ci_args``) the absolute check fails, so a red trunk stays visible.  ``--base REF`` overrides the
base; with no usable base the absolute judgement applies, loudly.

Exit code: 0 within budget, 1 over budget, 2 usage or unreadable budget.
