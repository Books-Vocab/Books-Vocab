        names to the values the caller's merge decision was based on. The write
        is one ``UPDATE ... WHERE id = ? AND is_deleted = 0 AND <expected>``, so
        a concurrent writer that changed any guarded column makes it a no-op.
        Returns the ids that were not written (conflicted, deleted or missing)
        so the caller can re-read and re-merge instead of clobbering.

        ``updated_at`` (the pull-sync cursor) is always bumped, so callers must
        pass only effective changes.
